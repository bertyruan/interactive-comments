- What I've learned
- don't over fit data. create a new type even if it differes by one property
- don't over fit setters. create a setter for each use case
- don't over optimize. use a simple data structure instead of a complicated one that requires complicated logic
- identify the most used cases for data. getting, setting, updating, deleting. for this, getting should be the cheapest
